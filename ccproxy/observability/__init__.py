"""
Observability module for the CCProxy API.

This module provides comprehensive observability capabilities including metrics collection,
structured logging, request context tracking, and observability pipeline management.

The observability system follows a hybrid architecture that combines:
- Real-time metrics collection and aggregation
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Request context propagation across service boundaries
- Pluggable pipeline for metrics export and alerting

Components:
- metrics: Core metrics collection, aggregation, and export functionality
- logging: Structured logging configuration and context-aware loggers
- context: Request context tracking and correlation across async operations
- pipeline: Observability data pipeline for metrics export and alerting
